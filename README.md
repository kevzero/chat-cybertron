Web chat test, for now only HTML & CSS but over time and perhaps with the contribution of you it could be carried out. Read the license for more information.
You can implement JS and other languages you want to be able to carry on this project.
Your help would be appreciated in order to carry on this project, initially it was only a test but then I decided to keep it and carry it on with your help. A nice common project can come.
